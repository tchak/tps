# fog-openstack 1.1.x builds the bulk-delete request body with `URI.encode`, which
# Ruby removed in 3.0, so `delete_multiple_objects` raises NoMethodError on any
# non-empty object list. `URI::DEFAULT_PARSER.escape` is the drop-in replacement:
# same escaping rules, and it keeps the `container/object` slash literal (unlike
# `ERB::Util.url_encode`, which would encode it and break the path).
#
# We PREPEND a module rather than reopen the class: fog requires the original request
# file lazily, on the first `Fog::OpenStack::Storage.new` (setup_requirements ->
# require_requests_and_mock), which happens AFTER this initializer. A class reopen
# would then be redefined (clobbered) by that require; a prepended module stays ahead
# of Real in the ancestor chain and wins whatever the load order.
#
# The request is also marked idempotent so Excon replays it on a transient failure
# (`retry_errors`: timeout, socket error, 5xx). Swift deletes the listed objects one
# by one, so a request of a thousand takes tens of seconds: long enough for ds_proxy
# to give up ahead of it (502 "Timeout while waiting for response") or for Excon's
# read timeout to fire. Replaying is safe: an object deleted by the first attempt is
# counted under "Number Not Found" on the next, not under "Errors".
#
# Past ~10 s, Swift sends the 200 and keeps the connection alive with whitespace until
# its JSON report is ready. A stream cut in between reaches us as a 200 whose body is
# only whitespace, so Excon has nothing to replay and the decode fails: we replay the
# request ourselves.
#
#   200 OK  "  \r\n\r\n{\"Number Deleted\": 1000, ...}"   complete
#   200 OK  "   "                                         cut -> Fog::JSON::DecodeError
